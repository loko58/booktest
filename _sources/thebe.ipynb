    "\n",
    "1. First, [add the common launch button configuration](launchbuttons/configuration). This makes it possible for `thebe/` to use the correct environment and file paths for your content.\n",
    "2. Activate Thebe integration with the following configuration:\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```yaml\n",
    "   launch_buttons:\n",
    "     thebe                  : true\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Configure Thebe\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition, you can configure the Binder settings that are used to provide a kernel for Thebe to run the code.\n",
    "These use the same configuration fields as the BinderHub interact buttons described above.\n",
    "For information about how to do this, see [the BinderHub launch button documentation](launchbuttons/binder)."
